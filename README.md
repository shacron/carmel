# Carmel

## Warning
This is a WORK IN PROGRESS. If you are looking for production-ready code, there are much better candidates than this project.

## A simple C standard library

This project contains a basic, partial implementation of the C standard library. The intended use is for embedded targets and other low-overhead code. As such, it does not plan to support localization, time zones, math libraries, and other big-system things. The implemented functions are very basic and unoptimized.

## Questions

### Why does this exist?

This is mostly a place for me to gather code that I end up rewriting often, and also just some fun writing the functions that we all depend on day to day.

### Will there be MY_DESIRED_FEATURE?

Probably not. I hope to do some general code optimization, and specific ones for arm and arm64, and possibly riscv.

### Should I contribute code?

I appreciate bug fixes. I am not looking for feature code from others, since that would defeat the purpose of this project. Maybe one day when it's more complete.

### Should I torpedo your hiring process because I found this code?

Definitely. Or you could talk to me about it.
